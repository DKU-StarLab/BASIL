üåø **BASIL** is a benchmark that evaluates the performance of 8 state-of-the-art learned and traditional indexes using sampling on sorted datasets. It is an artifact of ["Choi et al. Can Learned Indexes be Built Efficiently? A Deep Dive into Sampling Trade-offs. SIGMOD 2024"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3654919). It is built on the earlier benchmark [SOSD](https://github.com/learnedsystems/SOSD).

## 2. Build
### (1) Clone the repository and install dependencies.
On vanilla Ubuntu 20.04 LTS:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DKU-StarLab/BASIL.git
cd BASIL
sudo apt -y update
sudo apt -y install zstd python3-pip m4 cmake clang libboost-all-dev 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
### (2) Download datasets, build benchmarks, and generate query files.
```bash
./scripts/download_data.sh
./scripts/prepare.sh
./scripts/generate.sh
```

## 3. Run
### (1) Benchmarks Types
Five types of benchmarks can be conducted using the following scripts. All benchmarks measure the build time and index size according to the hyper-parameters of each index. The results from the scripts are saved as CSV files in the `results/` folder.
- `scripts/excute_avg.sh`: Measures the average lookup latency.
- `scripts/excute_tail.sh`: Measures the lookup latency at 0/50/90/99/99.9/99.99%th percentiles.
- `scripts/excute_sep.sh`: Measures the average latency of prediction and correction separately.
- `scripts/excute_perf.sh`: Measures the perf counter (LLC, TLB, Branch, Instructions) of prediction and correction separately.
- `scripts/excute_build.sh`: Does not perform lookups. 

### (2) Index Hyper-parameter Setting (Templates)
- Benchmarks can be performed by setting each index using the templates in the `benchmarks/` folder. This method of using templates is inherited from SOSD to avoid accidentally measuring vtable lookup times. However, this can lead to long benchmark build times.
- The `benchmarks/` folder contains parameters used in the paper's experiments. To avoid unnecessary long build times by compiling unnecessary templates, conditional compilation directives (`#ifdef`, `#endif`) were used to restrict compilation to only the required templates.
- If a user wants to perform a benchmark with newly defined parameters, they can input the parameters in the section defined by `#ifdef USER`, compile with `scripts/prepare.sh`, and then run the benchmark execution scripts described above.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: When changing conditional compilation directives (`#ifdef`, `#endif`) for a build, please reset the macro options stored in the CMake cache (`rm -rf build/CMakeCache.txt build/CMakeFiles/`). Otherwise, previously used conditional compilation directives may be included in the build. 

### (3) Reproduction
For reproduction, please refer to [reproduce.md](./reproduce.md) file.
